- Utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with LangChain and OpenAI API to proficiently 
extract data from diverse news articles.
- Innovatively designed and implemented a streamlined testing pipeline to assess the LLMs' 
performance with the extracted data. This initiative resulted in significant time savings, 
reducing manual testing efforts by 8 hours per testing cycle.
