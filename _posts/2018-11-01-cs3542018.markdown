- Developed a centralized platform in Django and PHP to streamline form filling, eliminating 
redundant data entry across different forms, resulting in substantial time savings.
- Introduced "placeholders" in forms, allowing users to input information once and 
have it populate in other forms automatically, optimizing data management and user efficiency.
- Designed a single-table database structure for simplified data storage and administration, 
with the ability to seamlessly integrate new fields, ensuring long-term scalability and 
effectiveness.
