- Researched and developed strategies for enhancing search efficiency in tree-based navigation, 
a pivotal aspect of robotics motion planning.
- Investigated SaIL, an algorithmic framework, and refined its loss function to promote 
admissibility, alongside experimenting with network architecture and state representation 
using image patches and CNNs.
- Evaluated these enhancements against established paper baselines, demonstrating a commitment 
to optimizing robotic motion planning processes.
