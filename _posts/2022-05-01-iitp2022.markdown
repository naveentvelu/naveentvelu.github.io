- Developed EP-GAN (Empathy and Persona-aware Generative Adversarial Network), a generative 
adversarial framework specializing in user-emotion-sensitive and persona-aligned response generation.
- Utilized memory vectors to encode persona information, integrating them with dialogue history 
to empower the decoder in crafting contextually relevant responses.
- Implemented an interactive adversarial learning mechanism to validate the 
elicitation of user emotion and persona within the generated dialogues.
