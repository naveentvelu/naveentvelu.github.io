- Investigated tree-based models from two angles: hyperparameter tuning techniques and categorical 
feature encoding strategies.
- The initial phase of the project focused on exploring various hyperparameter tuning methods 
due to their significant impact on model performance.
- Conducted empirical evaluations of (a) two Bayesian Hyperparameter tuning variants and 
(b) the Halving Random Search method, comparing them to the Random Search baseline.
- In the second phase, the project addressed the challenge of high-cardinality categorical 
columns by empirically assessing diverse categorical feature encoding methods.
