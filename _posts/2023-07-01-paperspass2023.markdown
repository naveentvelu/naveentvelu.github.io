- Investigated the N-BEATS interpretable deep learning forecasting model's capabilities in 
predicting 3-hour vital signs for sepsis patients in ICU settings.
- Leveraged the interpretable configuration of N-BEATS to forecast vital sign trends, 
facilitating a comprehensive understanding of patients' changing conditions and the impact of administered medications on vital signs.
- Conducted a rigorous evaluation of our methodology using the publicly accessible 
eICU Collaborative Research Database dataset, employing out-of-sample evaluation criteria.
