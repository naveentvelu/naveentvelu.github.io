- Researched automatic colorization, a field with broad applications, including B&W photo 
restoration, image recoloring, and enhancing grayscale drawings.
- Focused on automatic colorization in Manga, addressing challenges in manga coloring due to 
tight production schedules and costs.
- Leveraged Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models to improve manga 
colorization, aiming to enhance the reading experience and potentially expand the fan base.
